Building PDS4 Tools:

   This file describes how to make a source build of PDS4 Tools, for distribution on
   PyPi and on the SBN website.

   For building the PDS4 Viewer as a binary, see the PYINSTALLER file for instructions.

   Pre-Build Checklist:

      1) Was version in __about__.py updated?
      2) Was CHANGES.RST updated?
      3) Was the test suite run on all necessary Python versions?
      4) Have the Sphinx docs been updated for the new version?

   Building:

        Using Python 3, from the directory containing setup.py for pds4_tools, run:

        python -m pip install build
        python -m build

        This will make a compressed distribution inside the 'dist' directory.

   Post-Build Checklist:

      After examining the distribution to ensure all expected files were packed,

      1) Upload to PDS4 Python Tools wiki page.
      2) Change all references to previous version to use the new version on the wiki page.
      3) Post updated Sphinx docs.
      4) Ensure GitHub version is updated.
      5) Upload to PyPi via,

            Setup a ~/.pypirc file for both PyPi and TestPyPi. See:
            https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pypirc/#common-configurations

            python -m pip install twine
            twine upload dist/pds4_tools-xx.tar.gz
            twine upload dist/pds4_tools-xx-py2.py3-none-any.whl

            You may append  '-r testpypi' to the last two commands to upload to the test PyPi
            first. This will ensure there are no unexpected issues once uploaded to the real PyPi.
